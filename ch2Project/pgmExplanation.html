<h1>Explaining a Simple Grade Checker Program</h1>

<p>
This web page explains a short <abbr title="JavaScript">JS</abbr> program that decides whether a student
passes based on a test score. In this context, <dfn>JS</dfn> stands for <strong>JavaScript</strong>, a language
used to add logic to web pages. The idea is simple, but it shows how <em>input</em>, <var>variables</var>, and
<em>output</em> work together.
</p>

<h2>The Code Fragment</h2>

<p>
Below is the <mark>entire program</mark>. It is short and focused, which makes it easy to analyze:
</p>

<pre><code>
let score = 78;
let passingScore = 70;

if (score &gt;= passingScore) {
  console.log("You passed!");
} else {
  console.log("You did not pass.");
}
</code></pre>

<h2>How It Works</h2>

<p>
The specific variable <var>score</var> stores the <strong>input</strong> value <samp>78</samp>.
The variable <var>passingScore</var> is set to <samp>70</samp>. When the program runs, it compares these two values.
If <var>score</var> is greater than or equal to <var>passingScore</var>, the program prints the
<strong>output</strong> message <samp>You passed!</samp>.
Otherwise, it prints <samp>You did not pass.</samp>.
</p>

<p>
In practice, a user might type a number using the keyboard, such as <kbd>78</kbd>, and the program would evaluate it.
The result you see in the console is the program’s final decision.
</p>

<h2>Why This Matters</h2>

<p>
As <cite>Clean Code</cite> by Robert C. Martin explains, <q>Clean code always looks like it was written by someone who cares.</q>
This small example shows how even a tiny program can be written clearly and read easily.
</p>

<p>
Notice how the logic is easy to follow: first the data is stored, then a decision is made, and finally a message is shown.
This is a basic pattern you will see in many programs, from small scripts to large applications.
</p>

<p>
<small>
If you changed <var>score</var> to 65, the output would change, which demonstrates how sensitive programs are to their input.
